This is a template that can be used to work with Oxford Brookes Universityâ€™s VR-CAVE, which has a three-wall set-up with seven PCs: one host and two Image Generators (IGs) per wall, which synchronise in real-time, as depicted in Fig. 3. The IGs render the stereo images for projection onto glass screens surrounding the CAVE. All users wear three-dimensional (3D) Volfoni glasses. Vicon Vero cameras capture the positions and rotations of up to two pairs of glasses and associated Xbox 360 controllers, making this the first multiviewer stereoscopic system in the UK.
